 ==============================================================================


       KRIBER is an interactive PASCAL program to
       - calculate distances and angles.
       - generate input files for the program DLS-76 [1] and for the
         program LOADAT of the X-Ray Rietveld System XRS-82 [2].
       - calculate coordination sequences and loop configurations

 1. Description of the program  (will be sent to J. Appl. Cryst.)
    ==========================

 1.1 The crystallographic problem
     ----------------------------

 To set up an input file for the distance least squares program DLS-76 [1] or
 the geometric restraints for XRS-82 [2], all the symmetrically independent
 distances and angles of a framework have to be determined and DISTAN and ANGLE
 lines written in the correct format. This is time consuming, especially if the
 coordinates of the atoms are estimated from a physical model and the crystallo-
 graphic description of the connectivity of the atoms must be determined.
 From basic structural data, the program KRIBER generates complete input files
 for both programs and calculates additional topological values to test the
 connectivity of a framework.

 1.2 Method of solution
     ------------------

 The basic structural information (space group symbol, cell parameters, posi-
 tional coordinates and coordination numbers) is read interactively or from
 a file. The symmetry information for standard and non-standard settings is
 read from a supplied data file. The program calculates distances and angles.
 The connectivity of the atoms is determined automatically from the shortest
 interatomic distances, or can be generated and changed interactively.
 For framework oxide structures (e.g. zeolites), one can start with the
 non-oxygen atoms only (e.g. T-atoms) and after establishing the connectivity
 the program will place oxygen atoms midway between the non-oxygen atoms.
 Then an input file for the program DLS-76 (with or without TETCON lines) or
 for the program XRS-82 is generated, using prescribed values for the distances
 and angles from a user-supplied file.
 To test the topology, a procedure for calculating the coordination sequences of
 the framework [4,5,6] is also incorporated. Its result will be compared with
 the known coordination sequences listed in the Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types
 [7]. In addition loop configurations [8] can also be calculated to facilitate
 error checking (comparison of the internal model with the real one).

 1.3 Software and Hardware environment
     ---------------------------------

 The program is written in standard PASCAL and has been implemented and fully
 tested on a CYBER 855 running under NOS/VE 1.5.2. It has also been used
 successfully on a MicroVAX II machine under VMS 5.2. The program runs inter-
 actively. No external library is required.
 The output is written to the terminal screen and, if desired, to a list file.
 The longest line in the output file is 80 columns wide. No special peripherals
 are needed.

 1.4 Program specifications
     ----------------------

 The program consists of a main program, 123 procedures and 16 functions. It
 contains about 3300 lines of PASCAL source code. The maximum number of atom
 positions, bonds and independent bonds and angles can easily be changed before
 compilation in the constant declaration part of the source code.
 The program has been tested with different zeolitic frameworks.

 1.5 Documentation
     -------------

 A user manual is available as a machine-readable file. There is also an
 online-help command to show a summary of all commands. A worked example is
 provided.

 1.6 Availability
     ------------
 Copies of the user manual, the program source code and its data files are
 available from Ch. Baerlocher, Institute of Crystallography, ETH-Z, CH-8092
 Zurich, Switzerland. It can be provided via electronic mail, or on a
 user-supplied 9-track magnetic tape (1600 or 6250 bpi), TK50 or TK70. Tapes
 can be written with either COPY or VMS BACKUP format.
 A nominal fee (SFr 75.-) will be charged to cover handling costs.
