 AA0001 Memory request has exceeded the size of the QX array. If the job must
 AA0001 have this memory then the value of the macro memmax: must be increased
 AA0001 in XMACRO and all programs reinstalled.
 AA0002 This error arises when a program with recognisable XTAL name has not
 AA0002 been implemented OR the portion of the program name entered on the 
 AA0002 last input line matches a program that has not been implemented.
 AA0002 Check the call:'s in AA00 and/or use the full program name.
 AA0101 This is a common error exit in the XTAL system which, for many operating
 AA0101 systems, is not serious. It signifies that an end of file has been
 AA0101 encountered in the input image stream which controls the programs.
 AA0101 Either no FINISH line or some other unexpected input data is being
 AA0101 supplied in the input stream. On certain operating systems when no
 AA0101 orderly FINISH exit is carried out bdfs may be lost or left in limbo.
 AA0103 FINISH line encountered when another line required by current program.
 AA0104 An extension code is missing from the COPYBDF line
 AA0105 The SETID which has been supplied does not correspond to any line
 AA0105 identity being sought in the input stream.

 AA0107 Unrecognisable code encountered on a RESET line.     
 AA0108 Unexpected character code encountered on a RESET line.
 AA0110 This is the most common error exit in the XTAL system. It signifies that
 AA0110 an unexpected line ID was encountered in the input stream. The error
 AA0110 message printed out gives the line encountered.

 AA1005 Master bdf versions will not be created beyond '099'. Please 
 AA1005 reorganise the extension numbering of the master files.
 AA1101 The packet size specified for a logical record in a binary dat file is
 AA1101 larger than the I/O buffer size. This error requires changes in the
 AA1101 value of BDFBUF:, a check of the correctness of the program being
 AA1101 used, or an examination of the data supplied for the given crystal.

 AA1210 of the Xtal system that is incompatible with the current nucleus.

 ZZZ001 near them, on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies,
 ZZZ001 whose frown, and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command
 ZZZ001 tell that its sculptor well those passions read which yet survive,
 ZZZ001 stamped on these lifeless things the hand that mocked them,
 ZZZ001 and the heart that fed-

 ZZZ021 I may speak in tongues of men or of angels, but if I am without
 ZZZ021 love, I am a sounding gong or a clanging cymbal. I may have the
 ZZZ021 gift of prophecy, and know every hidden truth; I may have faith
 ZZZ021  strong enough to move mountains; but if I have no love, I am nothing.
 ZZZ021 I may dole out all I possess, or even give my body to be burnt, but
 ZZZ021 if I have no love, I am none the better.
 ZZZ021 Love is patient; love is kind and envies no one. Love is never
 ZZZ021 boastful, nor conceited, nor rude; never selfish, not quick to take
 ZZZ021 offence. Love keeps no score of wrongs; does not gloat over other
 ZZZ021 mens's sins, but delights in the truth. There is nothing love cannot
 ZZZ021 face; there is no limit to its faith, its hope, and its endurance.
 ZZZ021 Love will never come to an end. Are there prophets? their work
 ZZZ021 will be over. Are there tongues of ecstasy? they will cease. Is there
 ZZZ021 knowledge? it will vanish away; for our knowledge and our prophecy
 ZZZ021 alike are partial, and partial vanishes when wholeness comes.
 ZZZ021 When I was a child, my speech, my outlook, and my thoughts were
 ZZZ021 all childish. When I grew up, I had finished with childish things.
 ZZZ021 Now we see only puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we shall
 ZZZ021 see face to face. My knowledge now is partial; then it will be
 ZZZ021 whole, like God's knowledge of me. In a word, there are three
 ZZZ021 things that last forever: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of
 ZZZ021 them all is love.                                    1 Corinthians 13.
 ZZZ022 It takes greater character to carry off good fortune than bad.
 ZZZ022 French Proverb
 ZZZ023 We have seen that man on the average does not live above
 ZZZ023 two-and-twenty years. During these two-and-twenty years he is
 ZZZ023 liable to two-and-twenty thousand evils. Many of which are
 ZZZ023 incurable. Yet even in this dreadful state men still strut and
 ZZZ023 pose on the stage of life. They make love at the risk of destruction,
 ZZZ023 intrigue, carry on war, and form projects, just as if they were to
 ZZZ023 live in luxury and happiness for a thousand ages.       Voltaire

 ZZZ027 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might. For there
 ZZZ027 is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave,
 ZZZ027 whither thou goest.
 ZZZ027 I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to
 ZZZ027 the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to
 ZZZ027 the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet
 ZZZ027 favor to men of skill. But time and chance happen to them all.
 ZZZ027 For man also knoweth not his time. As the fishes
 ZZZ027 that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are
 ZZZ027 caught in the snare. So are the sons of men snared in an evil
 ZZZ027 time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.               Ecclesiaste
 ZZZ028 The enlightened one, because he saw mankind drowning
 ZZZ028 in the great sea of birth, death, and sorrow, longed to save
 ZZZ028 them, for this he was moved to pity.
 ZZZ028 Because he saw men of the world straying in false paths, and
 ZZZ028 none to guide them, for this he was moved to pity.
 ZZZ028 Because he saw the men of the world ploughing their fields,
 ZZZ028 sowing the seed, trafficking, huckstering, buying, selling,
 ZZZ028 and at the end winnowing nothing but bitterness,
 ZZZ028 for this he was moved to pity.....

 ZZZ039 See you now, your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth.
 ZZZ039 And thus do we of wisdom and of reach...
 ZZZ039 By indirections find directions out.             --Hamlet, II, 1
 ZZZ040 I would take counsel of myself. I would stop and look within
 ZZZ040 and looking within, look back, also that I may look ahead
 ZZZ040 with clearer understanding of the way I have been moving, and in
 ZZZ040 what direction. I need to know if I am going forward or retreating,
 ZZZ040 wether I have been wasting, or enjoying other precious moments
 ZZZ040 of life. There have been frictions, annoyances and sometimes wrath,
 ZZZ040 but were they because I was right and other wrong...
 ZZZ040 Have i had my thoughts too sharply focused.
 ZZZ040 On that which pleased me, served my self-esteem, disregarded my
 ZZZ040 security, of which I did not inquire whether it served or
 ZZZ040 hampered others.... Have I been trying to stop the clock to hold
 ZZZ040 the world in perpetuation of what was and is already slipping
 ZZZ040 away....Have I been critical of others for what really needed
 ZZZ040 changing in me.....Let me indeed take counsel of myself and set
 ZZZ040 my directions straight.  R.T. Weston as adapted by D. Osborn 1967
 ZZZ041 A man should never be ashamed to own he has been in the wrong,

 ZZZ054 But 'GLORY' doesn't mean 'A nice knock down argument'
 ZZZ054 Alice objected.  When I use a word, Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather
 ZZZ054 scornful tone, it means just what I choose it to mean.....
 ZZZ054 Neither more nor less.... The question is, said Alice,
 ZZZ054 whether you can make words mean so many different things....
 ZZZ054 The question is, said Humpty Dumpty, which is to be master....

 ZZZ062 We are not alone on the Universe, and do not bear alone the
 ZZZ062 whole burden of life and what comes of it.  Life is cosmic
 ZZZ062 event - so far as we know the most complex state of organis-
 ZZZ062 ation that matter has achieved in our cosmos.  It has come
 ZZZ062 many times, in many places - places closed off to us by
 ZZZ062 impenetrable distances. As men we can attempt to understand
 ZZZ062 it, even somewhat control and guide its local manifestations.
 ZZZ062 On this planet that is our home, we have every reason to wish
 ZZZ062 it well. Yet if it should fail, all is not lost. Our kind
 ZZZ062 will try again elsewhere.      WALD 'The Origin of the Universe'
